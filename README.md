## 🧠 Overview

Media, production, and vendor agreements are often lengthy, inconsistent, and time-consuming to review manually.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end AI-assisted workflow** that:

- extracts structured contract data from unstructured text  
- validates outputs against a defined schema  
- applies rule-based risk detection  
- produces analyst-ready outputs for review  

💡 Designed to simulate how AI systems can support **real operational and decision-making workflows**.

## 📊 Example Output

```
{
  "agreement_type": "Vendor Services Agreement",
  "parties": ["NBCUniversal", "Production Vendor Ltd"],
  "effective_date": "January 15, 2024",
  "term_length": "12 months",
  "payment_terms": "Net 90",
  "auto_renewal": true,
  "governing_law": "California",
  "exclusivity": true,
  "confidence_score": 0.88,
  "key_risks": [
    "Extended payment terms (>60 days)",
    "Auto-renewal clause present",
    "Exclusivity clause present",
    "Broad or one-sided indemnity language"
  ]
}
```

## 🚨 Risk Detection Engine

This system identifies high-risk contract elements such as:

⚠️Extended payment terms (>60 days)

⚠️ Auto-renewal clauses
  
⚠️ Missing termination flexibility

⚠️ Exclusivity clauses

⚠️ Missing governing law

⚠️ Broad indemnity language

➡️ This transforms the project from data extraction → decision support system

## 📓 Notebook Demo

jupyter notebook notebooks/demo_walkthrough.ipynb

Includes:

- Full pipeline walkthrough
- Structured outputs
- Analyst-friendly tables
- Risk insights

## 🧠 Analyst Insights

LLMs alone are not enough for reliable contract analysis.

This project shows the importance of combining:

- Structured schemas
- Validation layers
- Rule-based controls
- Confidence scoring
- Human review

➡️ Result: more reliable, auditable AI systems

## 🛡️ Responsible AI

- No real contracts used
- Synthetic / redacted data only
- Outputs require human validation
- Designed for auditability
- Acknowledges hallucination risk

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- LLM integration (OpenAI / RAG pipeline)
- Contract clause comparison engine
- Streamlit dashboard for analysts
- Evaluation framework (accuracy metrics)
- Real-time document ingestion

## 💼 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to:

- Contract intelligence
- Operational workflows
- Risk identification
- Decision support systems

Highly relevant to:

- Media & entertainment
- Vendor management
- Compliance & risk teams
